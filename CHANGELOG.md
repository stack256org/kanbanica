# Changelog

All notable changes to Kanbanica are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning policy

Given a version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** — incompatible changes: database migrations that require manual
  steps, removed/renamed environment variables, or breaking API changes.
- **MINOR** — new features and enhancements that are backward compatible.
- **PATCH** — backward-compatible bug fixes and small improvements.

Until `1.0.0`, the project is considered pre-release: `0.x` versions may include
breaking changes in a MINOR bump. From `1.0.0` onward, the rules above apply
strictly. Each release is tagged `vX.Y.Z` in git.

<!--
Maintainers: when cutting a release, move items from "Unreleased" into a new
dated section, e.g.:

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-01
### Added

-->

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- **Workspace timezone.** Each workspace has a timezone (defaults to `UTC`),
  used to decide what "today", "overdue" and week boundaries mean for everyone
  in it.
- `pnpm tz:dry-run` previews how existing dates will be converted and flags rows
  that need review before you migrate.

### Changed
- Task due dates, sprint start/end dates and custom DATE field values are now
  plain calendar days (`YYYY-MM-DD`) instead of instants, so a date no longer
  shifts when viewed from another timezone. CSV import/export uses the same
  day format.

### Upgrade notes
- Migration `0029_calendar_day_dates` converts existing dates in place. **Before
  upgrading**, set each workspace's timezone (especially ones with sprints
  started via "Start sprint") and run `pnpm tz:dry-run`, then review flagged
  rows.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- First-time users with no display name are asked for one (`/complete-profile`)
  before an invitation is auto-accepted or an invite link is joined.
- Workspace owners and admins are notified when someone joins through the
  shared invite link.
- **One container is now a complete deployment.** Run the image with no command
  and it applies pending migrations, then runs the web server *and* one
  background worker together — the flow you get from a platform that deploys a
  registry image once (Dokploy, Coolify, CapRover, a bare `docker run`). A new
  entrypoint (`scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`) picks the role; both processes are
  supervised, so if either one exits the container exits and your restart policy
  brings the pair back.
- `KANBANICA_ROLE` selects the role by environment instead of by command:
  `all` (the default — migrate + web + worker), or `app`, `worker`, `migrate`
  individually. Useful where setting an env var is easier than overriding a
  container's command.
- `KANBANICA_RUN_MIGRATIONS=false` skips the migration step, for a managed
  database whose application user may not run DDL. Defaults to `true` for
  `all`/`migrate` and `false` for `app`/`worker`.
- `.gitattributes` pinning `*.sh` to LF, so a Windows checkout can't bake a CRLF
  entrypoint into an image built with `docker-compose.build.yml`.

### Changed
- The image's default `CMD` is a sentinel (`kanbanica`) read by the new
  `ENTRYPOINT`, rather than `pnpm start`. **Any explicit command is still run
  verbatim**, which is how all three compose services continue to select their
  role — see the upgrade notes.
- `HEALTHCHECK --start-period` raised from 40s to 90s: in the default `all` role
  the web server starts only after migrations have been applied, and the
  migration step itself waits for a cold database.

### Fixed
- **Invitation acceptance showed "Invitation invalid" / "Unauthorized"** even
  though the invitation had been accepted. The invite page now checks the
  invite's state first, treats an invite already accepted by the current user as
  success, and shows a distinct message per error. A logged-out visitor's
  `/invite/<token>` now survives login. Blank user names fall back to the email
  in notification titles and the project Add Member dropdown. Documented in
  `docs/bugs/2026-10-02-bug-invite-accept-shows-invalid-and-blank-names.md`.
- **Background worker never started on a single-container deploy.** Pointing
  Dokploy (or any platform that runs the image once) at the registry image gave
  the web server alone: no worker, and no migrations. Because email is enqueued
  by the app and sent by the worker, magic-link sign-in silently never arrived —
  and `/api/health` passed throughout, so nothing looked wrong. Documented in
  `docs/bugs/2026-10-02-bug-worker-not-started-on-single-container-deploy.md`.

### Upgrade notes
- **Nothing to do for a `docker-compose.yml` deployment.** `docker compose pull
  && docker compose up -d` is the whole upgrade. All three services set
  `command:` explicitly, and the entrypoint runs an explicit command verbatim —
  behavior is unchanged. No migration needs manual steps, no environment
  variable changed, and both volume names and the runtime uid/gid (1001) are
  untouched.
- **Deploying a single container? Clear the command field.** If your platform's
  app has a command override set (e.g. `pnpm start` carried over from an earlier
  release), that still wins and you will still get the web server alone. Leave it
  empty to get migrate + web + worker.
- **Keep a single-container deployment at one replica.** Each replica would run
  its own worker, and two workers can double-process jobs. To scale the web tier,
  split the roles instead (`KANBANICA_ROLE=app` plus one `KANBANICA_ROLE=worker`)
  — and see the single-app-instance limit in `DEPLOYMENT.md` § 9.
- **Don't set `PORT`.** The image's `HEALTHCHECK` probes `:3000` inside the
  container; map the port externally instead.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Published-image install path: `docker compose up -d` now pulls
  `ghcr.io/stack256org/kanbanica` instead of building on your server. New
  `docker-compose.build.yml` covers build-from-source.
- `docs/releasing.md` documenting the release pipeline, and product screenshots
  in `docs/screenshots/`.
- `pnpm docs:sync` / `pnpm docs:check` (`scripts/sync-readme.mjs`) keep the
  README's `docker pull` block in step with `package.json`.

### Changed
- Docker: one image now serves all three roles (`app`, `worker`, `migrate`),
  selected by `command:` — `Dockerfile.worker` is removed and
  `next.config.mjs` no longer uses `output: "standalone"`. The image ships the
  real source tree with a `--prod` `node_modules`, so `pnpm worker:start`,
  `pnpm db:migrate:prod` and the admin-recovery scripts all run inside any
  container. This also removes the hand-maintained copy of sharp's native
  libvips that the standalone file-tracer needed.
- `docker-compose.yml` now **pulls the published image** instead of building
  locally (`docker compose up -d`, no `--build`), with `IMAGE_TAG` to pin a
  version and `APP_PORT` to move the host port. Build-from-source moved to the
  new `docker-compose.build.yml`; `docker-compose.external-db.yml` still
  overlays either one. Volume names are unchanged, so existing deployments
  reattach to their data.

### Fixed
- Documented commands that could not work: `pnpm worker:start` /
  `pnpm db:migrate:prod` were listed for an image with no `pnpm` in it, and
  `curl localhost:3000` was documented while the compose file bound no host
  port.
- README links, and the release workflow's handling of the commit CI actually
  tested (`workflow_run.head_sha` rather than `github.sha`).

### Upgrade notes
- **Nothing to do for a `docker-compose.yml` deployment.** `docker compose pull
  && docker compose up -d` is the whole upgrade. No migration needs manual
  steps, no environment variable changed, and both volume names and the
  runtime uid/gid (1001) are untouched.
- **`Dockerfile.worker` no longer exists.** If your platform (Dokploy, Coolify,
  Kubernetes, …) has a service configured to build from that path, point it at
  the single published image with `command: pnpm worker:start` instead. Same for
  a migration service: `command: pnpm db:migrate:prod`.
- **`docker compose up -d --build` no longer builds anything** — the default
  compose file has no `build:` section. Use
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build`.
- **The app now binds a host port** (`${APP_PORT:-3000}:3000`), where before it
  only used `expose:`. Behind a reverse proxy on the same Docker network,
  replace that block with `expose: ["3000"]`, or set `APP_PORT` to something
  free.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Open-source release preparation: `LICENSE` (MIT), `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`,
  `SECURITY`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, issue/PR templates, and CI (typecheck + build).
- Self-hosting support: application `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`,
  `/api/health` endpoint, container-safe migration runner, and `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Local-development guide (`SETUP.md`) and architecture overview
  (`ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- Configurable object storage via `STORAGE_DRIVER` (local / S3 / R2).
- Environment-overridable branding (support email, marketing domain).

### Changed
- Production startup now requires at least one authentication provider
  (SMTP or Google OAuth) so login cannot silently fail.

### Notes
- This is the pre-1.0 development line. The first public release will be tagged
  `v1.0.0` after the Release Candidate verification pass.
