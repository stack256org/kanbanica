# Admin Panel

> **Admin surfaces — canonical vs. legacy (audit note).**
> The codebase currently has **two** admin surfaces, and they are intertwined:
> - **`/orbit`** (`app/(orbit)/`) is the **canonical entry point** — admins are
>   redirected here after login (`app/post-auth/page.tsx`) and the in-app "Admin
>   Panel" button links here (`components/scaffold/app-shell.tsx`). It uses
>   session-based auth (`requireAdmin`, `lib/authz.ts`) and covers overview,
>   users, queues, email, and **integrations** (`/orbit/integrations` — SMTP,
>   Google OAuth, and storage config; see [docs/integrations.md](./integrations.md)).
> - **`/admin`** (`app/admin/`) holds most feature pages (workspaces, tickets,
>   help center, analytics, audit log), has its own **password-based** login
>   (`/admin/login`, used by `scripts/create-admin.ts`), and is reached via the
>   **shared** `AdminSidebar` that both surfaces render.
>
> Because the shared sidebar links to `/admin/*`, `/admin` has unique pages, and
> `/admin/login` provides password auth, **neither surface can be safely removed
> or redirected without breaking navigation or admin login.** Consolidating them
> is a deliberate refactor tracked as future work — do not delete either surface
> in the meantime. `AdminSidebar` now renders a different nav list per surface
> (`pathname.startsWith("/orbit")`), fixing a previous gap where `/orbit/*` pages
> had no sidebar entries at all — see `components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx`. The
> spec below documents the `/admin` feature set.

## Overview

The Admin Panel is an internal tool for the Kanbanica platform operators (us) to monitor, manage, and support the SaaS platform. It is completely separate from the customer-facing app and is not accessible to any customer regardless of their Workspace Role.

**Who has access:** Platform operators only. Access is defined by the platform role column **`user.role === "admin"`** (`ADMIN_ROLE` in `config/platform.ts`) — a distinct axis from `workspaceMember.role`, so being a Workspace Owner does NOT grant Admin Panel access. (The `is_platform_admin` boolean referenced elsewhere in this spec is aspirational; the shipped implementation uses `user.role`.) Gates: `requireAdmin()` (`lib/authz.ts`, used by `/orbit`) and `getAdminSession()` (`lib/admin-auth.ts`, used by `/admin` + all `/api/admin/*`), both re-read `role` + `banned` from the DB so a demoted/banned admin loses access immediately.

**How an admin is created:**
- **Self-hosted bootstrap (opt-in):** set `AUTO_PROMOTE_FIRST_ADMIN=true` and the **first** user to sign in is auto-promoted to platform admin (only fires when the user table is empty — see re-bootstrap note below). No terminal step needed.
- **CLI (always available / SaaS):** `pnpm create:admin <email> <password> [name]` or `pnpm make:admin <email>`.
- **In-app:** an existing admin promotes/demotes users on `/orbit/users`.

**Re-bootstrap / recovery:** auto-promotion is scoped to a genuine first boot (user table has exactly one row) — it will **not** silently promote a new signup on a running multi-user instance. If an instance ends up with zero admins (the sole admin deleted their account), recover with `pnpm make:admin <existing-member-email>`.

**Access URL:** `/orbit` (canonical) / `/admin` — protected routes, separate auth check

## Data Lifecycle

### PlatformAuditLog
- Audit log entries are **immutable and permanent** — never deleted, never soft-deleted.
- Even if a Workspace or User is deleted, their audit log entries are retained forever.
- This is the only table that survives Workspace and User deletion for compliance purposes.

### Workspace Force Delete (Admin action)
- Hard delete — same cascade rules as Owner-initiated workspace deletion.
- Sends notification email to workspace Owner before deletion.
- The deletion event itself is recorded in `PlatformAuditLog` before the workspace data is removed.
- No recovery period — immediate and permanent.

### User Ban / Unban
- **Ban:** Soft disable — User record stays intact, `banned = true`. All sessions revoked. User data preserved.
- **Unban:** Soft re-enable — `banned = false`. User can log in again. No data loss.
- Banning is **not** deletion — all workspace memberships, tasks, and comments are preserved.

### Impersonation Sessions
- Impersonation creates a temporary Session record with `impersonated_by` set to the admin's user ID.
- Impersonation sessions auto-expire after **1 hour** of inactivity.
- When the admin exits impersonation, the impersonated session is immediately hard-deleted.
- The `PlatformAuditLog` entry for the impersonation start is **never deleted**.

### Support Ticket Messages (Admin)
- Internal notes (`is_internal_note = true`) are never exposed to customers — no delete needed for security.
- Admin replies and internal notes are retained for as long as the Support Ticket exists.
- No individual message deletion in MVP (post-MVP: admin can redact a message).

---

## Business Rules

1. Admin Panel access is controlled by `is_platform_admin` flag on the User table — no customer role grants access.
2. Every destructive or sensitive admin action (ban, delete workspace, impersonation) is logged in `PlatformAuditLog` with actor, target, and timestamp.
3. Impersonation must be logged before the session is created — the log entry is written first.
4. While impersonating, the admin cannot perform irreversible actions: delete workspace, change password.
5. Impersonation sessions are time-limited — automatically expire after **1 hour** of inactivity.
6. Force deleting a workspace sends a notification email to the workspace Owner before deletion completes.
7. Internal notes on support tickets are never visible to the customer under any circumstance.
9. Resolving a support ticket automatically notifies the customer.
10. All admin API endpoints return `403 Forbidden` for non-platform-admin users — no information about the admin routes is exposed.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Impersonation Cleanup Job (Security-Critical)

Impersonation sessions auto-expire after 1 hour. This must be enforced by a background job -- the 1-hour rule has no effect without it.

```typescript
// src/lib/worker/job-types.ts
JOB_NAMES.IMPERSONATION_CLEANUP = "impersonation.cleanup"
QUEUE_OPTIONS[JOB_NAMES.IMPERSONATION_CLEANUP] = {
  retryLimit: 2,
}
```

**Cron schedule:** every 5 minutes

```typescript
// scripts/worker.ts
await boss.schedule(JOB_NAMES.IMPERSONATION_CLEANUP, '*/5 * * * *', {})
```

**Handler:**

```typescript
// src/lib/worker/handlers/impersonation-cleanup.ts

export async function handleImpersonationCleanup() {
  const cutoff = new Date(Date.now() - 60 * 60 * 1000)  // 1 hour ago

  // Better Auth stores impersonation sessions with impersonatedBy set.
  // Delete any impersonation session older than 1 hour.
  const expired = await db.session.findMany({
    where: {
      impersonatedBy: { not: null },
      createdAt: { lt: cutoff }
    },
    select: { id: true, impersonatedBy: true, userId: true }
  })

  if (expired.length === 0) return

  await db.session.deleteMany({
    where: { id: { in: expired.map(s => s.id) } }
  })

  // Audit log each expired session
  await db.platformAuditLog.createMany({
    data: expired.map(s => ({
      action: 'impersonation_expired',
      actorId: s.impersonatedBy!,
      targetUserId: s.userId,
      meta: { reason: 'auto_expired_1h' }
    }))
  })
}
```

**Idempotency:** safe to run multiple times -- `deleteMany` on already-deleted sessions is a no-op.

**Note on `impersonatedBy` field:** Better Auth's Admin Plugin adds this field to the Session model. Confirm the exact field name against the installed version of `better-auth` -- it may be `impersonatorId` depending on the plugin version. Check `node_modules/better-auth` types at setup time.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Role-based access within the Admin Panel (e.g. Support agent vs regular admin)
- Bulk user operations (bulk ban, bulk export)
- Advanced analytics (cohort analysis, funnel, retention curves)
- Customer-facing status page (uptime monitoring)
- Automated fraud detection
