# Task

## Overview

A Task is the core unit of work in Kanbanica. Everything actionable lives inside a Task. A Task always belongs to a List, inherits the Space's permission model, and can have Subtasks nested inside it.

Every task has a **human-readable ID** scoped to the workspace (e.g. `#1`, `#42`, `#103`). This ID is permanent, never reused, and is the primary way users reference tasks in conversation, comments, and external tools.

**Real-world analogy:** A Task = a work item, ticket, or to-do. e.g. `#12 Design login screen`, `#47 Fix payment bug`, `#103 Write Q3 report`

**Hierarchy position:**
```
Workspace
  L-- Space
        L-- List
                    L-- Task       <- you are here
                          L-- Subtask
```

## User Stories

- As a Member with Edit or Full Access, I want to create a task quickly by just typing a title so I can capture work without friction.
- As a Member, I want to fill in task details (assignee, due date, priority, description) after creation so I don't slow down during capture.
- As a Member, I want to assign a task to one or more teammates so ownership is clear.
- As a Member, I want to set a due date and priority so the team knows what is urgent.
- As a Member, I want to add a checklist inside a task to track smaller steps without creating subtasks.
- As a Member, I want to link a task as "blocked by" another task so dependencies are visible.
- As a Member, I want to watch a task so I get notified of updates even if it is not assigned to me.
- As a Member, I want to see the full activity timeline on a task so I know exactly what changed and when.
- As an Admin, I want to move a task to a different List when priorities change.
- As a Member, I want to duplicate a task to quickly create similar work items.

## Task Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Title | Short text | Yes | The name of the task |
| Description | Rich text | No | Detailed context — supports bold, italic, headings, bullet lists, numbered lists, code blocks, inline code, links. Type `/` to open a formatting command menu (the same actions as the toolbar). **The previous version is saved as a snapshot before each edit** (one level of recovery). Full version history with diff and restore is post-MVP. |
| Status | Enum (per List) | Yes | Defaults to first status in the List (usually "Todo") |
| Priority | Enum | No | None / Low / Medium / High / Urgent |
| Assignees | User[] | No | One or more workspace members |
| Reporter | User | Auto | Set to the user who created the task — cannot be changed |
| Due Date | Date or Date Range | No | Single deadline or start + end range |
| Tags | String[] | No | Custom multi-select labels scoped to the Workspace |
| Watchers | User[] | No | Users who follow the task and receive notifications |
| Attachments | File[] | No | Images, PDFs, documents — uploaded directly |
| Checklists | Checklist[] | No | Named checklists with checkable items inside the task |
| Dependencies | Task[] | No | Blocked by / Blocking relationships to other tasks |
| Subtasks | Task[] | No | Child tasks nested under this task |

> **Time Tracking:** a live timer + manual time log feature lives in the task detail (Time Tracking section) — start/stop a timer, log a completed block of time, and view a per-user history grouped by day. Not listed as a Task Field above because it's entry-based (many `TimeEntry` rows per task), not a single field. See `docs/time-tracking.md`.

> **Custom Fields:** beyond the built-in fields above, a Project/Workspace/List can define extra per-task fields (Text, Number, Checkbox, Single/Multi Select, Date, Person). See `docs/custom-fields.md`.

---

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Color | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| None | Grey | No priority set |
| Low | Blue | Nice to have, not urgent |
| Medium | Yellow | Normal priority |
| High | Orange | Important, do soon |
| Urgent | Red | Drop everything, do now |

## Features

### 1. Create Task

- **Who can create:** Members with **Edit** or **Full Access** on the Space, Admin, Owner
- **Quick create:** Click `+ Add Task` inside a List -> type title -> press Enter -> task is created instantly (title only)
- **Full create:** Open the Create Task modal to set **status, priority, description, due date, assignees, and tags** — all of these are persisted with the task on create (not only after creation)
- On creation:
  - Status defaults to the first `open` status in the List (e.g. "Todo") when none is chosen
  - Reporter is set to the current user automatically
  - Any priority, description, due date, assignees, and tags entered in the Create Task modal are saved with the new task
  - Creator + assignees are auto-added as Watchers; **assignees set at creation receive a `task_assigned` notification** (see `docs/notifications.md`)
  - Task appears at the bottom of the List (or top, based on user sort preference)

---

### 2. Task Detail Panel

Clicking a task opens a side panel (or full-page modal) showing all fields.

**Panel sections:**
- Header: Title (editable inline), Status pill, Priority badge
- Left/Main column: Description (rich text editor), Subtasks, Checklists, Attachments, Comments
- Right/Sidebar column: Assignees, Reporter, Due Date, Tags, Watchers, Dependencies
- Bottom: Activity Timeline

---

### 3. Edit Task

- **Who can edit:** Members with **Edit** or **Full Access**, Admin, Owner
- All fields are editable inline inside the Task detail panel
- Every field change is recorded in the Activity Timeline with timestamp and who made the change
- Editing is real-time — multiple users can view the same task simultaneously

---

### 4. Change Status

- Click the status pill on the task -> select from the List's statuses
- Status change triggers a notification to Assignees and Watchers
- When status type changes to `closed` -> task is marked as complete
- Completing a task does not archive or hide it — it stays in the List

---

### 5. Assign Task

- A task can have **multiple assignees**
- Search for workspace members by name or email in the assignee field
- **Only active members can be assigned** — users with a pending invite (`status = invited`) are excluded from the assignee picker entirely. They have not yet confirmed their account and cannot receive notifications or act on assignments.
- Any **active** member who has access to the Space can be assigned (regardless of their Space permission level — even View users can be assigned to tasks)
- Assigning a user sends them an in-app notification and email
- Removing an assignee sends them a notification

**Edge case — member removed after assignment:**
- If an assigned member is removed from the workspace (or their invite is cancelled before they accepted), their `TaskAssignee` record is kept but they lose all access to the task and workspace
- The task card shows their avatar as greyed out with a tooltip: `"This user no longer has access to this workspace"`
- Admins can re-assign or remove the stale assignee from the task detail panel
- This state is shown in the Activity Log as: `"[User] was assigned" / "[User] lost workspace access"`

---

### 6. Set Due Date

- **Single date:** a deadline
- **Date range:** start date + end date (useful for planning work blocks)
- **Validation:** the end date can never be before the start date. The calendars disable invalid days, and moving the start date past the current end date auto-clamps the end date to match.
- Due date appears on the task card in List and Board views — list/board rows show the **end date** (falling back to the start date when there's no end date), with a **days-remaining** label (e.g. "2d", "Today", "3d ago")
- Overdue tasks (past due date, not closed) are highlighted in red
- Due date triggers a reminder notification (default: 1 day before due date)

---

### 7. Priority

- Set or change priority from the task detail panel or inline in List view
- Priority is visible as a colored badge on task cards
- Can be used as a filter and sort criteria in List / Board views

---

### 8. Tags

- Workspace-scoped tags (shared across all Spaces in the Workspace)
- A task can have multiple tags
- Tags can be created inline when editing a task (type a new tag name -> create)
- Tags are used for filtering across Lists

---

### 9. Checklists

- A task can have **multiple named checklists**
- Each checklist has a name and a list of checkable items
- Checklist progress is shown as a fraction (e.g. `3/5`) on the task card
- Checklist items can be:
  - Added, renamed, checked/unchecked, reordered, deleted
  - Assigned to a user (optional)
  - Given a due date (optional)
- Completing all items in all checklists does **not** auto-close the task — status must be changed manually

---

### 10. Dependencies

- A task can be linked to other tasks as:
  - **Blocked by** — this task cannot start until the linked task is done
  - **Blocking** — this task is blocking the linked task
- Dependencies are visible in the Task detail panel
- Circular dependencies are **not allowed** (A blocks B blocks A) — enforced at the API level
- When adding a dependency, the server runs a **depth-first search (DFS)** traversal of the existing dependency graph. If the new link would create a cycle, the request is rejected with `400 Bad Request` and the message: `"Adding this dependency would create a circular reference"`
- Cross-List dependencies within the same Workspace are allowed
- Dependencies are **informational only** with respect to status changes — a task marked as "blocked by" an incomplete task can still be moved to Done. No hard block on status transitions.

---

### 11. Watchers

- Any workspace member can watch a task
- Watchers receive notifications for:
  - Status changes
  - New comments
  - Due date changes
  - Assignee changes
- Task creator and all assignees are automatically added as Watchers
- Watchers can remove themselves at any time

---

### 12. Attachments

- Upload files directly to a task (images, PDFs, documents, zip files)
- Supported: drag-and-drop or file picker
- Images are previewed inline in the task detail panel
- Non-image files show as a file card with name, size, and download link
- File size limit: **10MB per file** (MVP)
- Files are stored in S3-compatible storage

---

### 13. Activity Timeline

Every change to a task is recorded and displayed chronologically at the bottom of the task detail panel.

**Tracked events:**
- Task created
- Title changed (old -> new)
- Status changed (old -> new)
- Priority changed (old -> new)
- Assignee added / removed
- Due date set / changed / removed
- Description updated
- Comment added / edited / deleted
- Checklist item checked / unchecked
- Attachment uploaded / deleted
- Dependency added / removed
- Task moved to another List
- Watcher added / removed

Each entry shows: **who** did it, **what** changed, and **when** (timestamp).

---

### 14. Duplicate Task

- **Who can duplicate:** Members with **Edit** or **Full Access**, Admin, Owner
- Creates a copy of the task with:
  - Same title (prefixed with "Copy of")
  - Same description, priority, tags, checklists, status
  - **Not copied:** assignees, due date, comments, attachments, activity timeline
- Duplicated task is placed in the same List as the original
- User can edit all fields after duplication

---

### 15. Move Task

- **Who can move:** Members with **Full Access**, Admin, Owner
- A task can be moved to:
  - A different position within the same List
  - A different List within the same Space
  - A different List in a different Space (within the same Workspace)
- Moving preserves all task data (description, assignees, comments, attachments, activity)
- If moved to a different List, the task's status is mapped to the closest matching status in the destination List by name. If no match, it defaults to the first `open` status.
- Moving is recorded in the Activity Timeline

---

### 16. Copy Task Link

- Every task has a unique URL
- `Copy Link` option available from task detail header and task card context menu (`...`)
- Link format: `/[workspaceId]/task/[taskId]`
- Pasting the link in a comment or description creates a clickable task reference

---

### 17. Archive Task

- **Who can archive:** Members with **Full Access**, Admin, Owner
- Archived tasks are hidden from the List view by default
- Can be viewed via a filter: `Show Archived`
- No new comments or changes can be made to an archived task
- Can be unarchived at any time

---

### 18. Delete Task

- **Who can delete:** Members with **Full Access**, Admin, Owner
- Permanently deletes the task and all its data (subtasks, comments, attachments, checklist items)
- Requires single confirmation click
- Cannot be undone
- Recommended to Archive instead of Delete for audit trail purposes

---

### 19. Bulk Actions

Bulk actions allow users to apply changes to multiple tasks simultaneously from List View, the Sprint View, or My Tasks.

> **Scope:** bulk actions are scoped to the **Space**, not a single List. This lets the selection span multiple Lists (e.g. the Sprint View, where tasks come from different Lists). Bulk **status** updates derive the target status's own List from the status ID rather than assuming a single caller-provided list, keeping status changes valid across cross-list selections.

**Triggering bulk mode:**
- Hover over any task row -> a checkbox appears on the left
- Check the checkbox -> bulk mode activates, all row checkboxes become visible
- `Shift+Click` another checkbox -> selects all tasks in range
- Header checkbox -> selects / deselects all visible tasks (filtered set only)

**Bulk Action Bar** (fixed at bottom of screen while in bulk mode):
```
[[x] 5 selected]  [Assign]  [Status]  [Priority]  [Move]  [Archive]  [Delete]  [[x] Clear]
```

**Available actions and their behavior:**

| Action | Applies to | Behavior | Permission |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Assign | All selected | Opens member picker — replaces existing assignees on all selected tasks | Edit+ |
| Status | All selected | Dropdown of current List's statuses — sets all to chosen status | Edit+ |
| Priority | All selected | Sets all selected tasks to chosen priority level | Edit+ |
| Move | All selected | List picker — moves all selected tasks to chosen List; status remapped by name match | Full Access+ |
| Archive | All selected | Archives all selected tasks in one action | Full Access+ |
| Delete | All selected | Confirmation modal with exact count — permanently deletes all selected | Full Access+ |

**API shape for `POST /api/tasks/bulk`:**
```json
{
  "task_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "action": "set_status | set_priority | set_assignees | move | archive | delete",
  "payload": {
    "status_id": "uuid",
    "priority": "high",
    "assignee_ids": ["uuid"],
    "target_list_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

Response includes `{ succeeded: 3, skipped: 1, skipped_ids: ["uuid"] }` — tasks the user lacks permission for are skipped, not errored.

```
Task
+-- id                  (uuid, primary key)

L-- saved_at            (timestamp — when the snapshot was taken, i.e. when the edit started)
```

> **One snapshot per task (not full history):** `TaskDescriptionSnapshot` uses a unique constraint on `task_id` — each save overwrites the previous snapshot. This gives one level of recovery ("undo the last edit") without the storage cost of full version history. Full history with diff and restore is post-MVP.

## Data Lifecycle

### Archive
- Archived Tasks are hidden from List View and Board View by default.
- Viewable via the filter toggle: `Show Archived`.
- No new comments or field changes can be made on an archived Task.
- Subtasks are **not** auto-archived — they remain in their current state but are only accessible via the archived parent.
- Can be unarchived at any time — **no time limit**.
- When unarchived, the Task and all its Subtasks become immediately editable again.
- If the parent List is archived or deleted, the Task follows.

### Soft Delete
- Task deletion is a **hard delete** — no soft delete, no tombstone for the Task itself.
- Exception: **Comments** on a task use soft delete when the comment has replies (see [collaboration.md](./collaboration.md)).
- Archive is the recommended alternative to keep task history accessible.

### Recovery Period
- **Archived Task:** Recoverable at any time — no expiry.
- **Deleted Task:** No recovery. Data is permanently gone immediately.

### Permanent Deletion Rules
- **Full Access, Admin, and Owner** can permanently delete a Task.
- Requires a single confirmation click.
- On deletion, the following are permanently removed in cascade:
  - All Subtasks (and their own comments, attachments, checklists)
  - All Checklists and ChecklistItems
  - All TaskAttachments (DB records + files deleted from S3-compatible storage)
  - All Comments — soft-deleted tombstones are also hard-deleted at this point
  - All ActivityLog entries
  - All TaskAssignee, TaskWatcher, TaskTag, TaskDependency records
  - All TaskSprint records (task is removed from any sprint records)
  - All Notifications referencing this Task
- The Task record itself is deleted — no tombstone.

---

## Business Rules

1. Every Task has a `seq_number` that is unique per Workspace and auto-assigned at creation using an atomic increment on `Workspace.task_seq`. The displayed ID is `#seq_number` (e.g. `#42`).
2. `seq_number` is never reused — if a Task is deleted, that number is permanently retired.
3. Every Task must belong to exactly one List at all times.
2. A Task's status must be one of the statuses defined in its current List.
3. `seq_number` is derived from `Workspace.task_seq` which is incremented atomically on each task creation — use a DB transaction to avoid race conditions.
4. When a Task is moved to a different List, its status is remapped to the closest match by name; if no match, it falls back to the first `open` status.
5. Reporter is set at creation and cannot be changed.
6. Only **active** workspace members (`status = active`) can be assigned to a task — pending invites (`status = invited`) are excluded from the assignee picker.
7. Any active member with Space access (even View) can be assigned to a task — assignment does not grant edit permission.
8. A View-only member who is assigned a task can still only view it, not edit it.
9. If an assigned member loses workspace access after assignment, their `TaskAssignee` record is preserved but their avatar is shown greyed out — admins can clean up the stale assignment.
10. Task creator and all assignees are automatically added as Watchers on creation.
11. Circular dependencies (A blocked by B, B blocked by A) are enforced server-side — `POST /api/tasks/:id/dependencies` runs a DFS traversal and returns `400 Bad Request` if the new link creates a cycle. The check applies regardless of dependency direction ("blocked by" or "blocking").
12. Dependencies are informational with respect to status changes — they do not hard-block task status transitions. A "blocked" task can still be marked Done. The enforcement at rule 11 applies only to dependency creation, not to status changes.
13. Deleting a Task permanently deletes all its Subtasks, Comments, Attachments, Checklists, and ActivityLog entries.
14. Archiving a Task does not archive its Subtasks — they must be archived individually or will appear as orphaned subtasks.
15. File attachments are stored externally (S3-compatible storage) — deleting an attachment removes the DB record and the file from storage.
17. Tags are Workspace-scoped — the same tag can appear across multiple Spaces and Lists.
18. Bulk actions apply permission checks per task — tasks the user lacks permission for are silently skipped. The response reports how many succeeded and how many were skipped.
19. Bulk delete requires an explicit confirmation modal showing the exact count — there is no undo.
20. Each task modified by a bulk action generates its own individual Activity Log entry — bulk actions do not create a single grouped entry.

## Implementation Notes

### `taskSeq` Atomic Increment

`seq_number` must be assigned inside the task creation transaction using a row-locking update to prevent duplicates under concurrent requests:

```typescript
// Inside db.$transaction(async (tx) => { ... })
const [{ task_seq }] = await tx.$queryRaw<[{ task_seq: number }]>`
  UPDATE "Workspace"
  SET task_seq = task_seq + 1
  WHERE id = ${workspaceId}
  RETURNING task_seq
`
// Assign task_seq as the new task's seqNumber
```

Never use `findUnique` + `update` as two separate calls -- that pattern produces duplicate seq numbers under load.

### Dependency Cycle Detection (DFS)

On `POST /api/tasks/:id/dependencies`, run a DFS traversal before inserting:

```typescript
// src/lib/tasks/check-dependency-cycle.ts

async function wouldCreateCycle(
  taskId: string,
  newDependsOnId: string
): Promise<boolean> {
  // BFS/DFS: starting from newDependsOnId, follow its dependencies upward.
  // If we ever reach taskId, adding this edge creates a cycle.
  const visited = new Set<string>()
  const queue = [newDependsOnId]

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const current = queue.shift()!
    if (current === taskId) return true
    if (visited.has(current)) continue
    visited.add(current)

    const deps = await db.taskDependency.findMany({
      where: { taskId: current },
      select: { dependsOnTaskId: true }
    })
    queue.push(...deps.map(d => d.dependsOnTaskId))
  }

  return false
}
```

Call this before `db.taskDependency.create()`. Return `400 Bad Request` with `{ error: "Adding this dependency would create a circular reference" }` if it returns `true`.

For large dependency graphs, replace the above with a recursive CTE (more efficient, single DB round-trip):

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE dep_chain AS (
  SELECT depends_on_task_id AS task_id
  FROM "TaskDependency"
  WHERE task_id = $newDependsOnId  -- start from the proposed dependency target

  UNION ALL

  SELECT td.depends_on_task_id
  FROM "TaskDependency" td
  JOIN dep_chain dc ON dc.task_id = td.task_id
)
SELECT 1 FROM dep_chain WHERE task_id = $taskId LIMIT 1
```

If the CTE returns a row, a cycle would be created.

### `TaskDescriptionSnapshot` -- Always Use Upsert

The `task_description_snapshot` table has a `UNIQUE` constraint on `taskId`. Always use an insert-on-conflict upsert — never a plain insert:

```typescript
import { db } from '@/lib/db'
import { taskDescriptionSnapshot } from '@/db/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'

await db
  .insert(taskDescriptionSnapshot)
  .values({
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    taskId,
    content: previousContent,   // content BEFORE the current edit
    savedBy: actorId,
    savedAt: new Date(),
  })
  .onConflictDoUpdate({
    target: taskDescriptionSnapshot.taskId,
    set: {
      content: previousContent,
      savedBy: actorId,
      savedAt: new Date(),
    },
  })
```

A plain `insert` on the second save will throw a unique constraint violation. The `onConflictDoUpdate` pattern is required.

### Full-Text Search Limitation

`Task.description` is stored as Tiptap JSON in a `jsonb` column. PostgreSQL's `@@to_tsquery` operator does not work directly on `jsonb` values.

**At MVP (Phases 1-11):** Global search queries `title` only. Description search is not available.

**Post-MVP (Phase 11+):** Add a generated column to extract plain text via a raw SQL migration (Drizzle does not currently support PostgreSQL generated columns natively):

```sql
-- In a custom migration file in db/migrations/
ALTER TABLE task ADD COLUMN description_text text GENERATED ALWAYS AS (description->>'text') STORED;
```
Once added, index it:
```sql
CREATE INDEX task_description_text_fts ON "Task" USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', description_text));
```

Do not implement or imply full-task-content search in MVP. All search results are title-based only.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Recurring Tasks (daily / weekly / monthly / custom) — requires pg-boss cron patterns and DST/skip-weekend edge cases
- Task Templates
- Email-to-task (create task by sending an email)
- AI-generated task descriptions
- Task approval workflow
- Subtask progress auto-closing parent task
- **Description version history with diff and restore** — full history (like Notion's page history or Jira's description diff) is post-MVP. MVP provides one level of recovery via `TaskDescriptionSnapshot` (restore the immediately previous version only). Research note: ClickUp and Linear also do not offer description restore — they only log that the description changed, not what it was.
