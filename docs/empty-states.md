# Empty States & Onboarding Checklist

## Overview

Every screen a user can land on with no data must show a clear, helpful empty state — not a blank page. Empty states serve two purposes: explain what belongs here, and tell the user exactly what to do next.

**Design principles:**
- One illustration or icon (simple, not distracting)
- One headline — what this area is for
- One line of supporting text — why it's empty or what the user gains by filling it
- One primary CTA button — the single next action
- Optional secondary link — a less-commitment alternative (e.g. "Learn more")

Empty states are **not** error states. They are welcoming, not alarming.

## 1. Post-Onboarding Getting Started Checklist

When a brand-new user completes onboarding (Workspace created -> Space created -> lands in their first List), they see a **Getting Started checklist** panel pinned inside the empty List view.

This is the most important empty state in the product — it directly combats first-session churn.

### Layout

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|  👋 Welcome to Kanbanica, [First Name]!                  |
|                                                          |
|  Here's how to get started:                              |
|                                                          |
|  [x]  Create your workspace           (done)              |
|  [x]  Create your first Space         (done)              |
|  o   Create your first task          [Create task ->]     |
|  o   Invite a teammate               [Invite ->]          |
|  o   Set a due date on a task        [Learn how ->]       |
|  o   Try the Board view              [Switch view ->]     |
|                                                          |
|  Progress: ##......  2 of 6 complete                    |
|                                                          |
|                              [Dismiss checklist]         |
L----------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Checklist items

| Step | Completion trigger | CTA |
|------|--------------------|-----|
| Create your workspace | Auto-completed — already done | — |
| Create your first Space | Auto-completed — already done | — |
| Create your first task | User creates any task in any List | Opens quick-create inline |
| Invite a teammate | User sends at least one workspace invite | Opens invite modal |
| Set a due date on a task | User sets a due date on any task | Links to Help article |
| Try the Board view | User switches to Board view on any List | Switches view directly |

### Behavior

- Checklist is shown **pinned above the task list** inside the first List, only for the workspace creator
- Each item auto-checks as the user completes it — no manual ticking
- Progress bar fills as items are completed
- Once all 6 items are done: checklist collapses with a congratulations message: `"You're all set! 🎉 You've covered the basics."` then fades out after 3 seconds
- `[Dismiss checklist]` link hides it permanently (stored in `UserOnboardingProgress.dismissed_at`)
- Checklist is only shown to the user who created the workspace — teammates who join later do not see it
- Checklist persists across sessions until dismissed or completed

### Data model addition

```
UserOnboardingProgress
+-- id                   (uuid, primary key)
+-- user_id              (foreign key -> User)
+-- workspace_id         (foreign key -> Workspace)
+-- step_workspace       (boolean, default: true — auto-complete)
+-- step_space           (boolean, default: true — auto-complete)
+-- step_first_task      (boolean, default: false)
+-- step_invite          (boolean, default: false)
+-- step_due_date        (boolean, default: false)
+-- step_board_view      (boolean, default: false)
+-- dismissed_at         (timestamp, nullable)
L-- created_at           (timestamp)
```

---

## 2. Empty List (no tasks)

When a List has no tasks (freshly created, or all tasks have been deleted/moved).

### For the workspace creator (first List)

The first List is **never blank**. On onboarding completion, a single demo welcome task is auto-created inside it:

- **Title:** `"👋 Welcome to [Workspace Name] — click here to see how a task works"`
- **Description:** Pre-filled with a short walkthrough: *"This is a task. You can set a status, assign it to someone, add a due date, and leave comments. Try editing this task or create your own below."*
- **Status:** First open status of the List
- **Assignee:** The workspace creator (auto-assigned)
- **Tag:** `demo` (so it can be easily identified and deleted)

This gives the user something interactive to click on immediately — they learn by doing, not by reading a help article. The Getting Started checklist is shown below this task (not instead of it).

**Clicking "Create your first task" in the checklist** auto-deletes the demo task and opens the inline quick-create so the user starts fresh with their own real task. If the user deletes the demo task manually, the checklist step is also marked complete.

### For all other empty Lists

```
+------------------------------------+
|                                    |
|         📋                         |
|                                    |
|    This list has no tasks yet      |
|    Add your first task to          |
|    start tracking work             |
|                                    |
|      [ + Add your first task ]     |
|                                    |
L------------------------------------+
```

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Icon | Clipboard / checklist illustration |
| Headline | `"This list has no tasks yet"` |
| Subtext | `"Add your first task to start tracking work"` |
| Primary CTA | `"+ Add your first task"` — activates inline quick-create |

---

## 3. Empty Board View (no tasks in sprint / no tasks at all)

**Case A — List has tasks but none match current filters:**

```
|         🔍                         |
|   No tasks match your filters      |
|   Try adjusting or clearing        |
|   the active filters               |
|                                    |
|      [ Clear filters ]             |
```

**Case B — List has no tasks at all:**

```
|         📋                         |
|   No tasks in this board yet       |
|   Tasks you add will appear here   |
|   as cards in their status column  |
|                                    |
|      [ + Add a task ]              |
```

**Case C — Sprint is active but no tasks have been added to it:**

```
|         🏃                         |
|   No tasks in this sprint yet      |
|   Add tasks from the backlog to    |
|   define your sprint scope         |
|                                    |
|      [ Add tasks from backlog ]    |
```

---

## 4. Empty Calendar View (no tasks with due dates)

```
|         📅                         |
|   No tasks scheduled this month    |
|   Tasks with a due date will       |
|   appear on the calendar           |
|                                    |
|      [ + Add a task with due date ]|
|      [ See unscheduled tasks ->  ]  |
```

The Unscheduled sidebar is still shown on the right even when the calendar grid is empty — it may contain tasks without due dates.

---

## 5. Empty Backlog (no tasks outside a sprint)

Shown in the Sprint panel when all List tasks are assigned to sprints.

```
|         [x]                         |
|   Backlog is empty                 |
|   All tasks are in a sprint,       |
|   or there are no tasks yet        |
|                                    |
|      [ + Create a task ]           |
```

---

## 6. Empty Sprint Panel (no sprints created yet)

Shown in the Sprint panel when no sprints have been created for this List.

```
|         🏁                         |
|   No sprints yet                   |
|   Sprints let you time-box work    |
|   into focused iterations          |
|                                    |
|      [ Create your first sprint ]  |
|      [ Learn about sprints ->    ]  |
```

- CTA opens the Create Sprint modal directly
- Secondary link goes to the Help Center article on Sprints

---

## 7. My Tasks — No Assigned Tasks

Shown when the logged-in user has no tasks assigned to them across the workspace.

```
|         👤                         |
|   You have no tasks yet            |
|   Tasks assigned to you across     |
|   all Spaces will appear here      |
|                                    |
|      [ Browse your Lists ->     ]   |
```

- CTA links to the last viewed List (or the workspace root if none)
- No "create task" CTA here — My Tasks is a read view, not where tasks are created

---

## 8. Empty Space (no Lists)

When a Space is created but has no Lists inside it (edge case — normally a default List is auto-created, but the user may have deleted it).

```
|         📁                         |
|   This Space has no Lists yet      |
|   Lists are where tasks live —     |
|   create one to get started        |
|                                    |
|      [ + Create a List ]           |
```

---

## 9. Empty Folder (no Lists)

> **Not currently applicable.** Folder is post-MVP and not implemented (see `docs/folder.md`) — this empty state doesn't exist in the shipped UI yet. Kept here as the design reference for when Folder ships.

When a Folder has been created but no Lists have been added to it.

```
|         📂                         |
|   This folder is empty             |
|   Add a List to start organizing   |
|   tasks inside this folder         |
|                                    |
|      [ + Add a List ]              |
```

---

## 10. Notifications — No Notifications

When the user's notification inbox is empty.

```
|         🔔                         |
|   You're all caught up!            |
|   Notifications from task updates, |
|   mentions, and comments           |
|   will appear here                 |
|                                    |
```

No CTA needed — this is a positive state. Headline should feel like a success, not a problem.

---

## 11. Search — No Results

When global search (Ctrl+K) returns no matches for the query.

```
|         🔍                         |
|   No results for "[query]"         |
|   Try a different keyword,         |
|   or search by task ID e.g. #42    |
|                                    |
|   Recent searches:                 |
|   > Design login screen            |
|   > Sprint 3                       |
```

- Shows recent search history below (last 5 searches)
- No CTA — search result page, not a creation surface

---

## 12. Activity Log — No Activity on a New Task

When a task was just created and has no activity yet beyond the creation event.

```
|   Task created by [You]  just now  |
|                                    |
|   Activity will appear here as     |
|   changes are made to this task    |
```

Minimal — the creation event itself satisfies "not blank". No CTA needed.

---

## 13. Comments — No Comments Yet

When a task has no comments.

```
|         💬                         |
|   No comments yet                  |
|   Be the first to leave a comment  |
|   Use @ to mention a teammate      |
|                                    |
|   [ Write a comment... ]  <- opens  |
|                               the  |
|                             editor |
```

- The comment composer is always visible below this — so the empty state blends into the composer naturally

---

## 13a. Task Body — Progressive Disclosure (no subtasks / checklists / dependencies)

When a task has **none** of subtasks, checklists, or dependencies, the detail page does not render three empty section headers. Instead it shows a single subtle action to keep a fresh task uncluttered:

```
|  + Add subtask                      |   <- one left-aligned action
```

- Clicking **+ Add subtask** reveals the Subtasks section (open, with its inline add input focused) and the "Add checklist" / "Add dependency" actions.
- Once **any** of those sections has content, all the section actions stay visible — the disclosure does not collapse again.
- This is purely presentational; it does not change how subtasks, checklists, or dependencies are created. (See [subtask.md](subtask.md) §8 for the Subtasks section's own caret toggle and the "Completed (N)" row.)

---

## 14. Support Tickets — No Tickets

When the user has no support tickets submitted.

```
|         🎫                         |
|   No support tickets yet           |
|   Having an issue or a question?   |
|   We're here to help               |
|                                    |
|      [ Open a support ticket ]     |
|      [ Browse Help Center ->    ]   |
```

---

## 15. Feature Requests — No Requests (filtered view)

When the user filters the Feature Requests board and nothing matches.

```
|         💡                         |
|   No feature requests found        |
|   for this filter                  |
|                                    |
|      [ Clear filters ]             |
|      [ Submit a new request ]      |
```

---

## 16. Workspace Members — Only the Owner

When a workspace has only one member (the creator). Shown in `Settings -> Members`.

```
|   Just you here so far             |
|   Invite your teammates to         |
|   collaborate in Kanbanica         |
|                                    |
|      [ + Invite teammates ]        |
|      [ Copy invite link ]          |
```

- Two CTAs: email invite (primary) and copy link (secondary, lower commitment)

---

## Implementation Notes

### What NOT to do

- **No blank white space** — every empty area must have at least a headline
- **No generic "Nothing here" messages** — always explain what belongs here
- **No multiple CTAs competing** — one primary action per empty state
- **Do not show empty state while loading** — show a skeleton loader first, then the empty state only after the request confirms zero results

### Skeleton loaders vs empty states

| State | Show |
|-------|------|
| Data is loading | Skeleton loader (grey placeholder rows/cards) |
| Request completed, zero results | Empty state with message + CTA |
| Request failed | Error state with retry button (separate from empty state) |

### Permissions affect CTAs

If the logged-in user does not have permission to create (e.g. View-only member on a Space):
- Do not show "Create" CTAs in empty states
- Show only the explanation headline + subtext
- Example: View-only user seeing an empty List sees `"This list has no tasks yet"` with no create button

---

## Business Rules

1. Empty states are shown only after the data request completes with zero results — never while loading.
2. Skeleton loaders are shown during every data fetch — empty states replace the skeleton on completion.
3. The Getting Started checklist is shown only to the workspace creator in their first List — not to teammates who join later.
4. Getting Started checklist progress is tracked in `UserOnboardingProgress` — server-side, persists across devices.
5. Dismissing the checklist sets `dismissed_at` and hides it permanently for that user in that workspace.
6. CTAs in empty states respect the user's permission level — View-only users do not see "Create" buttons.
7. Filter-induced empty states always show a `[Clear filters]` CTA in addition to (or instead of) a create CTA.
8. The comment composer is always rendered below the comments empty state — the two elements together form the full empty comment section.

---

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Interactive product tour / tooltips overlay (post-MVP)
- Video walkthrough embedded in onboarding (post-MVP)
- Customisable empty state illustrations per team
- "Import from ClickUp / Asana" CTA in empty states (post-MVP — once import feature exists)
