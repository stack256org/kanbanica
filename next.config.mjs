    // layout.tsx, which renders the sidebar, is dynamic (calls headers()).
    // Opening a task (/[workspaceId]/task/[taskId]) and closing it back to the
    // list therefore re-ran the sidebar's server render on every close,
    // reading as a one-time blink. 30s (the pre-15 default) lets the shared
    // layout reuse its already-rendered output across this kind of quick
    // back-and-forth; an explicit router.refresh() (realtime updates) still
    // always bypasses this cache regardless of staleTime.
