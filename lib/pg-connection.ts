/**
 * Generic PostgreSQL connection-string normalisation.
 *
 * Kanbanica talks to Postgres through two different drivers:
 *   - `postgres.js` — the app (`lib/db.ts`) and the migration runner
 *   - `pg`          — pg-boss (`lib/worker/boss.ts`, `lib/worker/enqueue.ts`)
 *
 * They disagree about connection-string query parameters, which makes a URL
 * copied from a managed provider work with one and fail with the other:
 *
 *   1. `postgres.js` forwards any query param it doesn't recognise to the server
 *      as a *startup parameter*. Client-only params such as `channel_binding`
 *      are not server settings, so the connection is rejected.
 *
 *   2. `sslmode=require` means "encrypt, don't verify the certificate" to
 *      `postgres.js`, but "encrypt and verify strictly" to `pg`. The same URL
 *      can therefore connect in the app and fail TLS in the worker.
 *
 *   3. `pg` lets a parsed connection string OVERRIDE an explicit `ssl` option
 *      (see pg/lib/connection-parameters.js), so TLS can only be controlled
 *      consistently once `sslmode` is removed from the URL.
 *
 * `sanitizeDatabaseUrl` resolves all three: it strips client-only parameters,
 * turns `sslmode` into an explicit `ssl` config both drivers honour, and reports
 * whether prepared statements must be disabled.
 *
 * This is deliberately provider-agnostic — it reasons only about standard
 * PostgreSQL/libpq connection parameters. No hostname or port sniffing, and no
 * per-provider branches: any valid connection string should work anywhere.
 */
